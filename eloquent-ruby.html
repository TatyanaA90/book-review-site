                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>
                    It's easy to write correct Ruby code, but to gain the fluency needed to write great Ruby code, you
                    must go beyond syntax and absorb the Ruby way of thinking and problem solving.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In Eloquent Ruby, Russ Olsen helps you write Ruby like true Rubyists do so you can leverage its
                    immense, surprising power. Olsen draws on years of experience internalizing the Ruby culture and
                    teaching Ruby to other programmers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Eloquent Ruby starts small, answering tactical questions focused on a single statement, method,
                    test, or bug. You'll learn how to write code that actually looks like Ruby; why Ruby has so many
                    control structures; how to use strings, expressions, and symbols; and what dynamic typing is really
                    good for.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, the book addresses bigger questions related to building methods and classes. You'll discover
                    why Ruby classes contain so many tiny methods, when to use operator overloading, and when to avoid
                    it. Olsen explains how to write Ruby code that writes its own code and why you'll want to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He concludes with powerful project-level features and techniques ranging from gems to Domain
                    Specific Languages.

                    <h4>The first Ruby book I read in full within 24 hours</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> Peter Cooper</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> February 26, 2011</p>
                    <p>
                        This book is so easy to read yet so useful and informative that I read it in its entirety within
                        24 hours. Each chapter is titled as a guideline you should follow to write "eloquent" Ruby.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Russ adopts a chatty, familiar tone. Reading this book is like reading a book written for you by
                        a friend. Itâ€™s clean, practical, and surprisingly free of errors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone except those who could have written a similar
                        book themselves.

                    <h4>Eloquent Olsen</h4>
                    <p><strong>Reviewer:</strong> Fogus</p>
                    <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 7, 2011</p>
                    <p>
                        As a long-time Java developer, I found this book to be playful, fun, and deeply informative.
                        Russ Olsen has mastered the art of making a programming book feel human and readable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The book guides newcomers through Ruby's culture, idioms, and powerful features such as
                        metaprogramming and Domain Specific Languages. Russ helps you appreciate how Ruby enables
                        elegant and expressive code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is a must-read for any developer learning Ruby with real-world experience in other
                        languages.
